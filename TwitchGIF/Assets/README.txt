This solution is Windows only because it uses the System.drawing class library

TESTED ON Unity 2019.3.4f1

Copy and paste System.drawing.dll to Assets/Plugins folder
(You might need to create that folder if it doesn't exist already)

The .dll file can be found in: C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\[UNITY VERSION]\Editor\Data\MonoBleedingEdge\lib\mono\4.5
